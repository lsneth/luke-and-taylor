                <h1>Taylor:</h1>
                <p>
                    If someone would have told me that the first Saturday in Edmond, Oklahoma
                    I would meet my future husband I probably would have laughed because little did I
                    know who was going to be stepping off that bus. When I first saw you Luke I thought
                    you were so cute, but had to "play it cool" because I couldn't let you know. I
                    texted Kylee though and talked to Danielle about you. They were convinced we would
                    get married after I figured out how to swoop in. Oh how grateful I am that FSY had
                    to make so many changes because all those changes led me to you and changed my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the next week in Oklahoma I debated whether or not you kind of liked me too. I felt
                    like we were just naturally drawn together. We found ourselves walking together, eating
                    together, getting ice, throwing water, sitting together, and not to mention you drank
                    my slushie, but used that to get a hug;) smoooth! I also remember you asking me to dance
                    and finding an excuse to sit by me at the blazing hot baseball game. Theeen we somehow
                    convinced Ty that you needed to come to Texas with me and Lucas. That was the BEST news.
                    You asked me on our first date and I was so excited. We stayed up late talking and then
                    you asked to hold my hand on our date! I was beyond excited and just loved spending every
                    second with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Texas was so fun! We stayed up way too late and woke up really early. We danced the
                    dances away, did cool swing dance moves, and looked for frogs. You tried to keep me on
                    track with my masters and, well, we know how that went haha. Not going to lie, that last
                    night in Texas I wasn't sure what was going to happen, but I was really hoping you were going
                    to keep liking me and was a little panicked about it to be honest. After spending every day
                    together for those three weeks I was so sad it was coming to a close. But I saw you the next
                    day and we walked around temple square and I loved every second of it. I couldn’t stay away so
                    of course I had to see you before I left again… and so the long distance began!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked forward to our video calls every single day. You have no idea how much it meant to
                    me that you would wake up just to talk to me or plan your breaks around me. Honestly though
                    Luke, you helped me so much while I was in Arizona. It was such a hard time, but you were
                    there ALWAYS and let me rant about all the things. I loved our long phone calls, short phone
                    calls, Marco Polos, ugly face contests and all. You also surprised me with a Texas A&M shirt
                    that made my whole day. Finally, after four weeks away from you it was time to come home. I
                    didn’t think I would see you for a few days, but little did I know you planned to surprise
                    me at the airport. I can still see you standing behind the pole and me running full speed to
                    give you the biggest hug ever. Four weeks was just too long, but I was also just so glad you
                    still liked me lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A couple days later we were talking on the phone and I made a comment and then you go “I’d
                    break up with you… well we aren’t dating… hey Taylor, do you want to be my girlfriend?” It
                    definitely took me a second to realize you were being serious but I was STOKED. I came to see
                    you at FSY and we went to Kiwanis Park. We were having a great time until I realized you
                    might kiss me and I wouldn’t look at you. Finally I asked why you were looking at me and you
                    went for it. You told me you loved me and I replied with “Already?”... Ogh! I still feel sooo
                    bad! But on the inside I was so giddy. We then spent as much time together as possible before
                    Rexburg. We spent time at our families’ houses, had lots of hours on video call, rode bikes,
                    played mini golf, went to the rodeo, did an escape room, played games, went to Peach Days, you
                    helped in my classroom, and so much more.

                    Then there was the day you got me to hike to a mine. Thanks for being patient with me by the way.
                    This day and the ones leading up to it I had done lots of thinking and praying and FINALLY told
                    you I loved you. We were in the truck on our way back and it was time. I was so nervous for some
                    reason, but you asked the right questions and gave me the perfect moment to tell you. I mean those
                    words with my whole soul and my love grows for you each day.
