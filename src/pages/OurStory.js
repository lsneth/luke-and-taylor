                    <span className='dialogue'>Luke:</span> The idea of working at FSY was
                    so exciting to me, except for the fact that dancing is literally in the
                    job description. I almost didn’t go until Brad Wilcox visited my roommate’s
                    religion class and told all the students that one in five YSA that work at
                    FSY meet their eternal companion there. That was enough to get me to brave
                    a summer of dancing haha.
